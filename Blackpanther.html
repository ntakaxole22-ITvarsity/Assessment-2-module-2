<strong><p>SYNOPSIS</p></strong> 
<p>The king of the African nation of Wakanda who gains enhanced strength by ingesting the heart-shaped herb.He ascends to the throne following the death of his father T'Chaka in Captain America: Civil War (2016).Boseman called T'Challa an anti-hero who is "very much aware" of his responsibility as the leader of Wakanda.Black Panther's suit, which forms around his body, was inspired by a similar design in Ta-Nehisi Coates' Black Panther comic book run.For his Wakandan accent, Boseman worked with the same dialect coach he had for Message from the King (2016),and worked with Marrese Crump to stay in shape between Civil War and Black Panther.[</p>
